## What

Studio supports 5 key API Design and Documentation files in multiple formats. The general categories for these files is located within the file creation dropdown (**+**). They include:

- **API**: API Description Documents
- **Endpoint**: Individual Paths & Operations
- **Model**: Reusable API Components
- **Article**: Supplemental Markdown Files
- **Image**: Supplemental Images

> There are also three other categories of files listed in the file creation dropdown: File (generic file creation), Folder (used for organizing content in your Git repository and Studio), & New Project (create a new Project)
