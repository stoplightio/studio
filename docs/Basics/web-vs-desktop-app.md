# Studio Desktop vs. Studio Web 

Stoplight Studio is available in two different formats: desktop and web. Studio Desktop is an offline-first application that runs locally on your computer. Studio web is a web application that runs purely in your browser. There are a few differences that are outlined below: 

## Studio Web
The Studio Web interface is ideal for collaboration and working real time with existing hosted git repositories. IT is also where you will manage all your documentation.  

### Web-Only Features 
- [Publishing](../Documentation/06-publishing.md) documentation is currently only available in Studio Web, but Desktop users can set up [auto publishing from CI](../Documentation/07-publishing-via-cli.md). 
- [Downloading your Project](./download-project.md) to your local harddrive. 

## Studio Desktop
The Studio Desktop application provides an offline-first, native interface for designing and modeling your APIs. It also allows you to work directly with local files and folders on your computer. 

### Desktop-Only Features 
- Access local files and folders directly 
- Mock your APIs locally with [Prism](https://stoplight.io/prism)
